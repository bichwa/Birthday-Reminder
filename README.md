# Birthday-Reminder
Have you ever forgot someones birthday out of being ocupied with work, school or even life? I know how it feels. On this project, I am building a birthday reminder app that checks for the birthdays in my facebook page and automatically puts them in my google calendar. It then goes ahead to send them a custom message via their email and also notifies me so as to send them a personalized message. 

I am completely using the power of AI, Chat GPT -4 to be precise. I will be using Calendar  API from Google and Graph API from Facebook. Let the fun begin!
